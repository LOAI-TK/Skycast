# Skycast

# Abstract

This project aims to design and implement a real-time weather monitoring and forecasting system that combines Raspberry Pi‚Äìbased sensors with external weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap and WeatherAPI). Data is processed in Python, stored in Firebase Realtime Database, and visualized through both a website/web apps and a dashboard (Power BI).

The system addresses the limitations of traditional weather stations by offering scalability, low cost, remote access, and rich analytics.

**Disclaimer:** This project was developed as my graduation project in December 2022.
Please keep in mind that it may not be updated to reflect the latest changes, technologies, or best practices.

# Objectives

- Develop a low-cost IoT-based weather monitoring system using Raspberry Pi.

- Collect real-time temperature, humidity, and pressure data from sensors.

- Integrate data from external APIs (OpenWeatherMap & WeatherAPI) for forecasts, UV index, and air quality.

- Store and manage data in Firebase Realtime Database.

- Provide access through a website and web applications.

- Build an interactive dashboard to visualize and compare sensor readings with API data.

- Export structured datasets (CSV/Excel) for research purposes.

# Dashboard

An interactive dashboard (Power BI) and Tableau is used to:

- Compare sensor data vs API forecasts.
- Analyze temperature, humidity, and pressure trends.
- Track air quality, precipitation, and UV index.
- Provide time-series visualizations for research.

# Future Work


---
# Web 
- Make the website fully responsive across devices.
- Develop a web app for maps and radar visualization.

# Data Analysis
- Add lag and rolling window features for time-series analysis.

# Visualisation
- Build a more advanced dashboard with:
- Interactive filters (date ranges, location-based queries).
- Time-series anomaly detection highlights.
- Multi-panel comparison (sensor vs. API vs. forecast).
- Integration with the web app for live weather visualization.

# Hardware 
- Build a complete weather station that integrates additional missing sensors (e.g., wind speed/direction, rainfall gauge).
