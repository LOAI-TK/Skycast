# Skycast

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This project was developed as my graduation project in December 2022.
Please keep in mind that it may not be updated to reflect the latest changes, technologies, or best practices.

Abstract

This project aims to design and implement a real-time weather monitoring and forecasting system that combines Raspberry Pi‚Äìbased sensors with external weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap and WeatherAPI). Data is processed in Python, stored in Firebase Realtime Database, and visualized through both a website/web apps and a dashboard (Power BI).

The system addresses the limitations of traditional weather stations by offering scalability, low cost, remote access, and rich analytics.

üéØ Objectives

Develop a low-cost IoT-based weather monitoring system using Raspberry Pi.

Collect real-time temperature, humidity, and pressure data from sensors.

Integrate data from external APIs (OpenWeatherMap & WeatherAPI) for forecasts, UV index, and air quality.

Store and manage data in Firebase Realtime Database.

Provide access through a website and web applications.

Build an interactive dashboard to visualize and compare sensor readings with API data.

Export structured datasets (CSV/Excel) for research purposes.
